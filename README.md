Two Sum
Easy
Company Tags
Hints
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return the indices i and j such that nums[i] + nums[j] == target and i != j.

You may assume that every input has exactly one pair of indices i and j that satisfy the condition.

Return the answer with the smaller index first.

Example 1:

Input: 
nums = [3,4,5,6], target = 7

Output: [0,1]
Explanation: nums[0] + nums[1] == 7, so we return [0, 1]

Medium
Company Tags
Hints
Given an integer array nums, find a subarray that has the largest product within the array and return it.

A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.

You can assume the output will fit into a 32-bit integer.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,-3,4]

Output: 4

Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array
Medium
Company Tags
Hints
You are given an array of length n which was originally sorted in ascending order. It has now been rotated between 1 and n times. For example, the array nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6] might become:

[3,4,5,6,1,2] if it was rotated 4 times.
[1,2,3,4,5,6] if it was rotated 6 times.
Notice that rotating the array 4 times moves the last four elements of the array to the beginning. Rotating the array 6 times produces the original array.

Assuming all elements in the rotated sorted array nums are unique, return the minimum element of this array.

A solution that runs in O(n) time is trivial, can you write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time?

Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,4,5,6,1,2]

Output: 1

Search in Rotated Sorted Array
Medium
Company Tags
Hints
You are given an array of length n which was originally sorted in ascending order. It has now been rotated between 1 and n times. For example, the array nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6] might become:

[3,4,5,6,1,2] if it was rotated 4 times.
[1,2,3,4,5,6] if it was rotated 6 times.
Given the rotated sorted array nums and an integer target, return the index of target within nums, or -1 if it is not present.

You may assume all elements in the sorted rotated array nums are unique,

A solution that runs in O(n) time is trivial, can you write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time?

Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,4,5,6,1,2], target = 1

Output: 4

3Sum
Medium
Company Tags
Hints
Given an integer array nums, return all the triplets [nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]] where nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == 0, and the indices i, j and k are all distinct.

The output should not contain any duplicate triplets. You may return the output and the triplets in any order.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [-1,0,1,2,-1,-4]

Output: [[-1,-1,2],[-1,0,1]]

Number of One Bits
Easy
Company Tags
Hints
You are given an unsigned integer n. Return the number of 1 bits in its binary representation.

You may assume n is a non-negative integer which fits within 32-bits.

Missing Number
Easy
Company Tags
Hints
Given an array nums containing n integers in the range [0, n] without any duplicates, return the single number in the range that is missing from nums.

Follow-up: Could you implement a solution using only O(1) extra space complexity and O(n) runtime complexity?

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3]

Output: 0
Explanation: Since there are 3 numbers, the range is [0,3]. The missing number is 0 since it does not appear in nums.

Reverse Bits
Easy
Company Tags
Hints
Given a 32-bit unsigned integer n, reverse the bits of the binary representation of n and return the result.

Example 1:

Input: n = 00000000000000000000000000010101

Output:    2818572288 (10101000000000000000000000000000)
Explanation: Reversing 00000000000000000000000000010101, which represents the unsigned integer 21, gives us 10101000000000000000000000000000 which represents the unsigned integer 2818572288.

Coin Change
Medium
Company Tags
Hints
You are given an integer array coins representing coins of different denominations (e.g. 1 dollar, 5 dollars, etc) and an integer amount representing a target amount of money.

Return the fewest number of coins that you need to make up the exact target amount. If it is impossible to make up the amount, return -1.

You may assume that you have an unlimited number of each coin.

Example 1:

Input: coins = [1,5,10], amount = 12

Output: 3
Explanation: 12 = 10 + 1 + 1. Note that we do not have to use every kind coin available.

Longest Increasing Subsequence
Medium
Company Tags
Hints
Given an integer array nums, return the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence.

A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from the given sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

For example, "cat" is a subsequence of "crabt".
Example 1:

Input: nums = [9,1,4,2,3,3,7]

Output: 4
Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [1,2,3,7], which has a length of 4.
