Hints
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return the indices i and j such that nums[i] + nums[j] == target and i != j.

You may assume that every input has exactly one pair of indices i and j that satisfy the condition.

Return the answer with the smaller index first.

Example 1:

Input: 
nums = [3,4,5,6], target = 7

Output: [0,1]
Explanation: nums[0] + nums[1] == 7, so we return [0, 1]

Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

You are given an integer array prices where prices[i] is the price of NeetCoin on the ith day.

You may choose a single day to buy one NeetCoin and choose a different day in the future to sell it.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve. You may choose to not make any transactions, in which case the profit would be 0.

Example 1:

Input: prices = [10,1,5,6,7,1]

Output: 6
