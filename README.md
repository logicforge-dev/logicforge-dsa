Two Sum
Easy
Company Tags
Hints
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return the indices i and j such that nums[i] + nums[j] == target and i != j.

You may assume that every input has exactly one pair of indices i and j that satisfy the condition.

Return the answer with the smaller index first.

Example 1:

Input: 
nums = [3,4,5,6], target = 7

Output: [0,1]
Explanation: nums[0] + nums[1] == 7, so we return [0, 1]

Hints
You are given an integer array prices where prices[i] is the price of NeetCoin on the ith day.

You may choose a single day to buy one NeetCoin and choose a different day in the future to sell it.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve. You may choose to not make any transactions, in which case the profit would be 0.

Example 1:

Input: prices = [10,1,5,6,7,1]

Output: 6

Products of Array Except Self
Medium
Company Tags
Hints
Given an integer array nums, return an array output where output[i] is the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].

Each product is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

Follow-up: Could you solve it in 
O
(

)
O(n) time without using the division operation?

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,4,6]

Output: [48,24,12,8]

Maximum Subarray
Medium
Company Tags
Hints
Given an array of integers nums, find the subarray with the largest sum and return the sum.

A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,-3,4,-2,2,1,-1,4]

Output: 8

Hints
Given an integer array nums, find a subarray that has the largest product within the array and return it.

A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.

You can assume the output will fit into a 32-bit integer.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,-3,4]

Output: 4
