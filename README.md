Hints
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return the indices i and j such that nums[i] + nums[j] == target and i != j.

You may assume that every input has exactly one pair of indices i and j that satisfy the condition.

Return the answer with the smaller index first.

Example 1:

Input: 
nums = [3,4,5,6], target = 7

Output: [0,1]
Explanation: nums[0] + nums[1] == 7, so we return [0, 1]
