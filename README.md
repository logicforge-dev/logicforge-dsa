Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array
Medium
Company Tags
Hints
You are given an array of length n which was originally sorted in ascending order. It has now been rotated between 1 and n times. For example, the array nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6] might become:

[3,4,5,6,1,2] if it was rotated 4 times.
[1,2,3,4,5,6] if it was rotated 6 times.
Notice that rotating the array 4 times moves the last four elements of the array to the beginning. Rotating the array 6 times produces the original array.

Assuming all elements in the rotated sorted array nums are unique, return the minimum element of this array.

A solution that runs in O(n) time is trivial, can you write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time?

Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,4,5,6,1,2]

Output: 1

Search in Rotated Sorted Array
Medium
Company Tags
Hints
You are given an array of length n which was originally sorted in ascending order. It has now been rotated between 1 and n times. For example, the array nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6] might become:

[1,2,3,4,5,6] if it was rotated 6 times.
Given the rotated sorted array nums and an integer target, return the index of target within nums, or -1 if it is not present.

You may assume all elements in the sorted rotated array nums are unique,

A solution that runs in O(n) time is trivial, can you write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time?

You are given an integer array nums where nums[i] represents the amount of money the ith house has. The houses are arranged in a circle, i.e. the first house and the last house are neighbors.

You are planning to rob money from the houses, but you cannot rob two adjacent houses because the security system will automatically alert the police if two adjacent houses were both broken into.

Decode Ways
Medium
Topics
Company Tags
Hints
A string consisting of uppercase english characters can be encoded to a number using the following mapping:

'A' -> "1"
'B' -> "2"
...
'Z' -> "26"
To decode a message, digits must be grouped and then mapped back into letters using the reverse of the mapping above. There may be multiple ways to decode a message. For example, "1012" can be mapped into:

"JAB" with the grouping (10 1 2)
"JL" with the grouping (10 12)
The grouping (1 01 2) is invalid because 01 cannot be mapped into a letter since it contains a leading zero.

Given a string s containing only digits, return the number of ways to decode it. You can assume that the answer fits in a 32-bit integer.

Example 1:

Input: s = "12"

Output: 2

Explanation: "12" could be decoded as "AB" (1 2) or "L" (12).

Clone Graph
Medium
Topics
Company Tags
Hints
Given a node in a connected undirected graph, return a deep copy of the graph.

Each node in the graph contains an integer value and a list of its neighbors.

class Node {
    public int val;
    public List<Node> neighbors;
}
The graph is shown in the test cases as an adjacency list. An adjacency list is a mapping of nodes to lists, used to represent a finite graph. Each list describes the set of neighbors of a node in the graph.

For simplicity, nodes values are numbered from 1 to n, where n is the total number of nodes in the graph. The index of each node within the adjacency list is the same as the node's value (1-indexed).

The input node will always be the first node in the graph and have 1 as the value.

Example 1:



Input: adjList = [[2],[1,3],[2]]

Output: [[2],[1,3],[2]]
Explanation: There are 3 nodes in the graph.
Node 1: val = 1 and neighbors = [2].
Node 2: val = 2 and neighbors = [1, 3].
Node 3: val = 3 and neighbors = [2].

Hints
There is a foreign language which uses the latin alphabet, but the order among letters is not "a", "b", "c" ... "z" as in English.

You receive a list of non-empty strings words from the dictionary, where the words are sorted lexicographically based on the rules of this new language.

Derive the order of letters in this language. If the order is invalid, return an empty string. If there are multiple valid order of letters, return any of them.

A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if either of the following is true:

The first letter where they differ is smaller in a than in b.
a is a prefix of b and a.length < b.length.
Example 1:

Input: ["z","o"]
